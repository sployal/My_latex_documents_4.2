	\section*{Introduction}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item let's begin with a formulae $e^{i\pi}+1=0$ but we can also do   
		
		$$e=\lim_{n\to\infty}\left(1 + \frac{1}{n}\right)^n = \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{4}{\sqrt[n]{n!}}$$
		
		\item we can do another:
		$$e=\sum_{0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n!}$$
		
		\item we can also use continued fractions 
		
		$$e=2+\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{2+\frac{1}{3+\frac{3}{5+ \ddots}}}}$$
	\end{itemize}

	\section*{Fourier Analysis}
	
	Fourier analysis is a mathematical method used to analyze functions or signals in terms of their constituent frequencies. It is based on the idea that any periodic function can be decomposed into a sum of simple sine and cosine functions, known as Fourier series. The continuous version of this, known as the Fourier transform, allows the representation of a function as an integral of sine and cosine functions over continuous frequencies. This method is widely applied in signal processing, physics, and engineering for analyzing waveforms, solving partial differential equations, and compressing data.
	
	Mathematically, the Fourier transform of a function \( f(x) \) is given by:
	
	$$ \hat{f}(\xi) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{-2 \pi i x \xi} \, dx $$
	
	This formula transforms the function \( f(x) \) from the time domain into the frequency domain, where \( \xi \) represents the frequency. The inverse Fourier transform allows us to recover the original function from its frequency components.
